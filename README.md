# xCAT

xCAT is a toolkit for deployment and administration of clusters of all sizes.

# xCAT sunset was only a quick eclipse

Since the news regarding the sunsetting of xCAT, we as a company, decided to continue the development providing fixes and patches for xCAT, including new OS releases while there's still interest available on the xCAT community for the product.

We do believe that xCAT still have place in multiple systems, not only older ones but also new ones, and to affirm this belief, we are already delivering, as sign of commitment with the project:

* Enterprise Linux 10 support.
* Removal of `xcat-dep` repository hard dependency.
* Lots of quick fixes.

xCAT3 is a forked release from the latest xCAT2 with some improvements and should be considered as a drop in replacement for existing xCAT installations.

Repositories with binary packages, available at this moment only for Enteprise Linux 10, are available for installation:
https://mirror.versatushpc.com.br/opencattus/xcat3

We want also to thank for all the efforts made by the xCAT Consortium in the last years working to keep the product alive.

The continued development of this project is delivered as-is and free of charge by [VersatusHPC](https://versatushpc.com.br).
